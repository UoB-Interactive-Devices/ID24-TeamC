2. Press on a button and a sound or smell comes out.
3. Interactive floor display that responds to footsteps or gestures, like waves or water.

### Manami :
1. DO TOUCH - Reproduce the tactile sensations of a work of art without touching it. 

    _Motivation_: Although artworks are often prohibited from being touched, there must have been times when people were tempted to touch them. Even if there is a sample on display, it is not hygienic to touch it, and the fact that it is a fake may not satisfy the tempt. 'Do touch' investigates how reproducing the tactile sensation without touching affects the experience at museum.
      

2. What-Ifs Canvas - Simulate the impact of the artist's life events on the work.

    _Motivation_: Enjoying art fully often requires some background knowledge. But unless you're really into art, it's hard to learn about an artwork's background just from the small descriptions next to it. By showing important events in the artist's life, let people to remove the events. Then, we show what the art might have been like if the artist's life had been without the selected events. In this work, we investigate if people can intuitively deepen their understanding of the art and the artists theirselves.

3. ArtMingle -  Make new social interaction through art

    _Motivation_: Museums bring together people with one thing in common: they have time and some interest in art. However, there are many psychological barriers to new social interactions. So when some people who secretly want to talk to each other are looking at the same artwork, the artwork poses open questions about the artwork. We investigate how facilitating new interactions affects the museum experience and subsequent interactions.
