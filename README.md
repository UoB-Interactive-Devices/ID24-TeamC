## Ideas
### Lauren:
1. Digital arcaheology
2. Knock over the colston statue
3. Pose for the painting game: Kid must stand skill as they are slowly 'painted' on a screen. Shows how pre-cameras art used to take a long time
4. Chip away rock to make hieroglyphics
5. Hieoglyphics->English translator
6. Digital jigsaw- organs in the right jars, dinosaur bones in the right place

### Hiro:
1. look into the lens and it will take you to the scene it happened, click button to change the scene. (Hiromichi)
2. Make the object and It will do fortune telling according to the theme. (Hiromichi)
3. Kid can take the object from start to end of the museum which allow them to interact and talk or quiz with it  because they like bringing toy to everywhere and it keeps them         entertained with it without boredom. (Hiromichi)

### Wren:
1. Scavenger Hunt: Provide a map with hints of the hidden buttons around the museum, visitors search for them and can press a button to access educational information.
2. Press on a button and a sound or smell comes out.
3. Interactive floor display that responds to footsteps or gestures, like waves or water.

### Manami :
1. DO TOUCH - Reproduce the tactile sensations of a work of art without touching it. 

    _Motivation_: Although artworks are often prohibited from being touched, there must have been times when people were tempted to touch them. Even if there is a sample on display, it is not hygienic to touch it, and the fact that it is a fake may not satisfy the tempt. 'Do touch' investigates how reproducing the tactile sensation without touching affects the experience at museum.
      

2. What-Ifs Canvas - Simulate the impact of the artist's life events on the work.

    _Motivation_: Enjoying art fully often requires some background knowledge. But unless you're really into art, it's hard to learn about an artwork's background just from the small descriptions next to it. By showing important events in the artist's life, let people to remove the events. Then, we show what the art might have been like if the artist's life had been without the selected events. In this work, we investigate if people can intuitively deepen their understanding of the art and the artists theirselves.

4. ArtMingle -  Make new social interaction through art

    _Motivation_: Museums bring together people with one thing in common: they have time and some interest in art. However, there are many psychological barriers to new social interactions. So when some people who secretly want to talk to each other are looking at the same artwork, the artwork poses open questions about the artwork. We investigate how facilitating new interactions affects the museum experience and subsequent interactions.

### Xiaoxiao :
1. Build a 3D Model Map featuring galleries across different floors with a small toy moving around.
2. Navigate through each gallery and upon completion, press a button to guide a virtual avatar to the next exhibition.
3. Press the button when people finished the certain gallery.

### Group: A mummy act as the monitor to control four Canopic jars
![alt text](https://museumofmythology.com/Egypt/canoptic%20jars/canoptic%20jars/canoptic%20jars-1.jpg)
1. _Background_: In ancient times, a mummy, once a powerful pharaoh, is tasked with guarding four Canopic jars, each embodying the preserved organs for the afterlife. 
2. _Interactions_:

| Actions  | Methods/Outcomes |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Light  | Light sensor  |
| Squeeze| Sound ”Do not squeeze me wwwwww”  |
| Smile  | A curl line of lights   |
| Smell  | ?  |
| Unscrew the head  | The sound of the lid popping off a soda bottle  |

3. _Motivations_: It's designed to be a multi-time and attractive game, inspiring both children and adults acquire more knowledge of ancient Egypt. With no clear instructions on how to play with it, let people to investigate each button/organ's functionality.
   
##bold: Investigation question: Interactive mummy: How do we balance hedonia(happiness and flow) with realism when trying to  use technology to get users to engage with darker parts of world history?
Novelty: We could use atypical materials.E.g. Clay in place of wires and bandage/gauze fabric buttons. If we want to use AI we could 1. have an auto-turn off for scent 2.have an ai that adapts in the intensity of certain experiences such as light and sensation intensity(less novel. Might need to encorporate deep learning)
3.Invert a new haptic sensation for touching the jars and focus solely on comparing it to pre-existing sensations End Lauren rant

Since this method can recreate many depth cues, it possesses the possibility of fully recreating a lifelike impression of exhibits.
