-Traditionally museum visits are seen as a constructive activity used to drag kids away from screens
-However, the separation of cbbc and cbeebies as separate channels from the bbc and an overall evolution of media has led to a number of changes in how parents view digital media and games as a tool in the education of their children#
-For example, the multimedia success of horrible histories demonstrated how the use of classic digital and hedonic tools can lead to learning becoming a multi-generational experience https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/news-events/news/2018/03/horrible-histories-bringing-children-an-irreverent-take-on-the-past-for-25-years/#
-Now museums are increasingly trying to embrace new technology and gamification to encourage interaction with our past[find citation].
-This paper will explore the process of designing [describes our exhibit] and the reported response we had in trying to innovate a new immersive museum experience.
-Description of fossil exhibition: A structured play/educational simulation activity that reflects local paleotological and anthropological discoveries.
Certainty: Interaction with artefacts is reflects through uncovering digital replicas that are encased in 'rock'
Uncertainty: Will they be in an archive or hidden in an area for people to discover (treasure hunt style)
