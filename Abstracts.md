-Traditionally museum visits are seen as a constructive activity used to drag kids away from screens
-However, the separation of cbbc and cbeebies as separate channels from the bbc and an overall evolution of media has led to a number of changes in how parents view digital media and games as a tool in the education of their children#
-For example, the multimedia success of horrible histories demonstrated how the use of classic digital and hedonic tools can lead to learning becoming a multi-generational experience https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/news-events/news/2018/03/horrible-histories-bringing-children-an-irreverent-take-on-the-past-for-25-years/#
-Now museums are increasingly trying to embrace new technology and gamification to encourage interaction with our past[https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2020/coronavirus-education].
-This paper will explore the process of designing [describes our exhibit] and the reported response we had in trying to innovate a new immersive museum experience.
-Description of fossil exhibition: A structured play/educational simulation activity that reflects local paleotological and anthropological discoveries.
Certainty: Interaction with artefacts is reflects through uncovering digital replicas that are encased in 'rock'
Uncertainty: Will they be in an archive or hidden in an area for people to discover (treasure hunt style)


## Idea 2 : **What-Ifs Canvas** 
Simulate the impact of the artist's life events on the work for learning art history.

### Abstract

We introduce 'What-if Canvas', simulating the impact of the artist's life events on the work to deepen users' understanding of the art work. 
For art appreciation, a comprehensive understanding often necessitates background knowledge about the artwork and its artist. 
However, in a museum, visitors are usually given only one-way supplemental information by text or audio. 
This research proposes an interactive system that allows users to explore pivotal events in an artist's life and hypothetically remove them, leading to a visualization of how these changes might have altered the artist's work.
Through this study, it aims to allow the user to visually realise the impact of the life event, enhancing their insight into the artwork and the background information of the artwork.
